But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.

1,Fingerprint sensor key didn't respond even to lock/unlock the display of the phone for one day. So wasn't able to even restart the phone. Then it started to work fine on its own. Camera is average. Display is just fine but quality issues r main concern. Refund request raised is still unanswered. Better to go with Samsung.
1,Except camera this phone was not an upgrade to my realme 3 pro. Sold it within 8 months of usage. Slow and hangs. Multiple problems in calling like mic sensitivity. Camera is good but I hardly care about it. Not worth the price unless camera is essentially important to you

1,"I regret buying this watch and that too from Flipkart -
Avoid this watch and Save you hard earned money.
I just received it today, i can say for sure that battery backup and charging are pathetic on watch 4.
Don't fall for the high discounts or features of this watch. It takes 2-3 hours to charge completely and lasts only for 1 day. So you need to charge it for almost 3 hours every single day and its damn painful.
And please make sure to check the return policy before buying any product on F...

1,"Battery and charging department is the worst by Samsung. Takes so much time to charge and battery even can't stand a day , even if all sensors are turned off. Plus it heats up during wireless charging in summer and stops charging automatically , till temp is down. Watch even lags during heat.
Charging is really very slow and worst experience by Samsung. Overall for fun watch is good."

screen LED burn effect after 15 min AOD display."

Before purchasing the watch please keep the drawback in mind and go for the purchase. Rest of the options works fine as mentioned over the specifications, but the actual option call receiving from the watch to the Bluetooth headset ...

1,"It's a good watch but useless in terms of integration.
Data is only visible within Dizo app and not accessible to Google fit or healthify me.
Useless data. Better buy mi for it's robust and reliable ecosystem. Even my 4 years old mi band has a better data accuracy and integration than this. Don't get carried away by the looks and features. Yes it's good. But all these is pointless if I'm not able to use it for any calculation of calories."
1,People who have hairy wrists should avoid this. Heart Rate censor doesn't work if you have hairy wrists..Same with other censors. Nearly an year old huawei band 6 works better than this.
1,"Step tracker is not very bad
Heart rate and spo2 is good
And i show I walk only 50 to 100 step but steps show in watch is 400 to 600 and it is not useful but
This watch designs ,display, features is very good
The problem of this watch is they no track accurate step"
1,"Basic Activity tracking itself not working properly. Am very disappointed and surprised , how come DIZO is supporting that many sport modes, despite the simplest step count feature itself is buggy and very inaccurate. It adds 20 steps to every 10 steps you walk .. I recommend buyers not to go by the reviews who are only talking about looks and design... This watch main purpose is for activity tracking, If that doesn't work well, who cares about looks and design.
Forget about returning the pro...

1,"Pls don't buy, if you wanna return the product it's not allowing you to return. One of the worst Smart watch, if you are riding in motorbike, it's calculating the walking steps count. Activity tracking is worst."

1,It does not work. I am not able to return it also. Very much disappointed by flipkart.
1,Totally disappointed. Activity tracker is a disaster. Riding a bike counted as steps. How can a human being run at the speed of 70KM/H. Application is not user friendly. It shows nothing. It took 2 days to complete setups. Sleep monitor also not working. Heart rate monitor show false information. Horrible UI.
1,Wrost
1,Battery backup very low
1,Its a typical Chinese product. Buying it was a mistake. Very poor battery back up. The battery drains out in a couple of days even without usage. I don't know why flipkart gives a window to such brands on their site. Overall a bad product. Please don't buy.
1,Poor mic not working properly
1,It was not as per mentioned specifications and returned the item.
1,"Video quality not good at all. And when you put the camera in the case and record a video, you cannot hear the audio since the case blocks the voice. And you cannot mount it on your helmet or head without putting the case on. If you wanna vlog, or just record a biking video, you will not be able to hear the audio"

2,"I purchased this router in March 2013 and by August it stopped working. As rightly said by other reviewers, TP-Link's customer care and toll free numbers are not working and they take ages to reply to emails. Another bad point is the lack of service centres in all states, for example, in Kerala they do not have any service centres, so I have to send it to Bangalore to get it checked. Flipkart was awesome in proving contact details of service centres, but when I rang them, the service centre r...

2,The product is really bad...after 7 days network not receive
2,Coverage range is very Low
2,not good for online gamers
2,The product is not upto the mark it automatically disconnects the wifi and internet connection by itself
2,Not coming more than 20Mbps even in 100 Mbps connection
2,Not good.
2,"It says connectivity 500sqft, but the range is only 150-200 sqft, this product which I got was a replacement, first it was delivered defective but no refund and exchange and I have to compromise with same product"
2,Very poor internet
2,Device is not bad but heats up very quickly
2,Only power light is working. Rest of everything is not working at all. First bad experience from flipkart
2,"It diasappointed me , i purchased 1200 mbps for good wifi range converage for my home but it covers as like my previous 300 mbps wifi range"
2,Not 100miter covarage jast good
2,Lower range detected...not value of money....
2,Speed is fluctuating and high ping.
2,Range is not good. Signal strength is also bad.
2,Wifi range downstairs is bad
2,5G indicator stopped working.
2,Not do job costly donot purches
2,Majorly it doesn't work as expected and what it seems and described the frequency catch is very low even in minor distance like 6 to 7 feet
2,"Bad product,"
2,Not that strong conectvity
2,This router not supported 100 MBPS in range on 5 metre. Average speed to 30 and 35 mbps
2,Not worth
2,Useless router
2,Exact 7 days it's worked fine after that router automatically turned off every time we have check and rest start the router very bad experience I dont have option to return the product bcoz return policy date completedüòûüòûüòû
2,Bad range
2,"Always having an issue, the wifi keep dropping. May be defective product. I may need your technical support Engineer to come and check it."
2,Very bad packing. Nowadays flipkart doing good package clothes and apparels but for electronic equipment doing very worst packing.Totally disappointed.
2,Bad product low quality
2,Not connected without Lan cable
2,"The modem is not working properly , the network of router is slow in my phone ,butit is normal in pc"
2,Not good
2,Average router.
2,Speed extended is below 10 mbps even if WiFi range is above 50 mbps
2,Stupid one. Reduces 50% speed when connected to primary router.
2,"Not of use.. writing this review after good usage...
This is a few month after usage, the range is not extended though the speed is poorly maintained either i connect directly to my wifi router or through this extender. I just wasted money..Think before you buy."
2,"Device is is working, but as per current trend the average speed 20 to 30 MBPS is not being fulfilled its maximum speed is 12 to 10 MBPS Even thought we are getting speed of 60 MBPS over main modem.

Need to improve things in this aspect as per market and description of the product need to be changed accordingly"
2,"Not satisfied. Speed is going up and down continuously. Some time disconnects automatically. Price is also very high than other routes. I raised a complaint regarding the problems facing with this product. A technician visit was scheduled by Flipkart. But the technician did not come and phoned me and asked me for some photos of the router on WhatsApp and closed my issue without any house visit. Now I called Flipkart again and informed him about the same. Customer service is very bad and is no...

2,"Very Poor WiFi coverage on 5g band, Working Voltage for this router is 9 v which is wrongly mentioned 12v under discreption page"
2,"Product was a defective piece, was not getting range on the same floor within 2 m"
2,Range is very low for 3 bhk flat of 1000 sqft and don‚Äôt purchase for home having more cornered wallüò°üò°ü§¨üò°üò°
2,Its not worth the money. I have a 3 bed room flat (single floor) and in spite of it these two routers are unable to cover the entire floor. Its mere a repeater with a ONLY advantage of same SID name... DO NOT BUY
2,I had data plan of 300 mbps. But the speed through this is only 15 mbps now
2,"Works till yesterday suddenly stopped working I think power adapter dead, lights near lan cable blinking, power indicator light is not getting on"
2,"Expecting more range from this. I have Dlink at my hometown which is having good range and connectivity, but it seems Dlink is degraded in its range quality, not getting very good range as well as speed, checked with several IP's but same result.."
2,The router is just worest
2,I mainly bought it for wireless printing. It does this job flawlessly. No complaint on that part. Overall it is a decent router for this price. The wifi range is not wide like TP link routers though. But very stable and reliable connection. But for my type of usage I felt the lack of Wifi on/off switch. At this price point that functionality should be provided.
2,Wifi range major issue.
2,"The speed is good. If you have a broadband connection with 160mbps speed, you can expect 70-90mbps. But the range isn't that good. I have 3BHK and signals beyond walls are certainly week."
2,"lot of connectivity issues with printer. Hence not recommended.
I have to discard the router because of this. Need to check for warranty."
2,Range is not good
2,not worked more than 4 months. dont buy.
2,doesn't support 100mbs literally
2,My broadband line is 20 mbps if i connect directly.. While connecting it with router it becomes 4 mbps.. Its working but not expected.
2,"Expected better range with dual Antenna.
has the same coverage as my single antenna TP-Link 8 years old wifi router.
Slightly better speed even at low range.
I should have researched myself than listening to a friend."
2,Wifi range is very bad only single room covered.
2,5g band support is very poor
2,Its range is very less as compared to Tenda router I was using earlier. Gonna return it.
2,Not good
2,Low speed
2,Had frequently signal packets dropping and network disconnection. The strength of signal is also fluctuating and not stable.
2,Too complex and doesn't work as expected
2,"Not Very Impressive
With wifi 6 Device Actual Speed test upto 600Mbps on 5Ghz. But Very Disappointed by 2Ghz you will get around 50Mbps... way less expected.
2ghz performance is just like N300 Models of any Router.

My opinion waste of Money. Regretted after Buying.
There are many other Cheap option with mostly same performance."
2,Heating issue. Speed fluctuations isuue
2,Only one USB port
2,Wifi speed is very slow with airtel sim. Checked with customer support... no improvement.
2,Wifi connection drops often. No firmware update
2,Sim try is very cheap
2,Heat problem
2,"Not working fine , heating problem"
2,"Not as useful, effective, efficient and durable as claimed."
2,My 300m router was much better in coverage really disappointed
2,Bad range networking
2,Covareg is not good. One room to another room lose 2 signal bar.
2,Too much low security..
2,Horrible product
2,Disconnecting issues. Heats a lot while in use.

2,Bought the product after lot of review consideration but sure that even 3 piece set doesn‚Äôt give much strength to a 1300 sqft area . Any wall deteriorates the wireless connectivity badly . And only bachhaul with wired connection to each gets you speed but if that is the case why would you go for such expensive mesh system
2,This is good consumer product but should have option to configure from browser rather than relying only on app. That makes me think skeptical as we have to relay on tplink app which works over tplink cloud. If tplink decides to dispose this product then it‚Äôs simple that remove the cloud support then this router is useless

3,Pixel per inch is very less so quality is not so good.
3,Look is good. But display quality is not perfect.
3,"Just received the monitor. Works well but, you need to put two screws to mount the monitor on a stand . The screws are too small they won't fit."
3,"good monitor in low cost.

3,Good for gaming but for productivity work not so good as text appears pixelated.
3,"Pixel density is low.
Other features are excellent."
3,Good product In this price I purchased it only 10500/-
3,"This comes with a 16a plug which won't fit in most of our normal sockets. It requires international 16a sockets. Considering the actual power consumption of the monitor, this is absolute overkill. Why does it comes with a 16a plug? To make our lives miserable? Maybe because this piece was never designed for Indian/international consumers. Which is still mediocre.



But the monitor is quite decent in itself. No complaints there."
3,Gaming and Display is better
3,Lower Brightness is too high for night use
3,So nice computer but there is a damage
3,Everything is good but the power supply cable is 15A cable this too big for any ups
3,The monitor is good. The clarity of the picture is good. But the text is fuzzy. The icon edges are a slight fuzzy too. My Lenovo Laptop produces a pure HD image clarity while the Samsung monitor clarity is no match against it. I bought by the brand reputation. M slightly disappointed. I got the Samsung engineer visiting us at home. But the product is built like that. We can improve the text clarity or the icon clarity.
3,average packing.neat delivery.moniter clarity.is average.samsung quality is very low in manufacturing level.so other companies are degrading Samsung.sligtly disappointing.
3,screen is fixed with stand. it should provide function to move the screen as per convenience.

3,"Very low sound and looking good , not adjustable or move to suitable. Remaing is very good , not provide hdml cable, audio cable available"
3,Product is Good but it is LCD Monitor i think.You can not see the image clearly from side view.only display will be clear if u sit in front of it.
3,"it's not hd+ display. it's only hd display. Flipkart should correct that otherwise those information makes no sense for any product.

Hdmi and vga both port available. Inbuilt speakers are there with average quality. If single person wants to watch a movie those speakers good enough.

I connected my firetv stick with it and its works like a charm. Inbuilt speakers supports the firetv stick."
3,Go for it...
3,Product seems to be good and was delayed may due to COVID--19 restrictions or other operational reason. Overall seems to good but need to revisit the review after observing for 6 months. The only challenge is it comes with 15 amps power plug which is usually different. My previous monitors till date was 5 amps. So you need by an adapter or change your switch box.
3,"Here are the cons of this monitor
1) It has a 16amp power plug. So it won't fit in normal socket or spike.
2) Color not accurate. if you are using this for designing purposes."
3,Height not adjustable.. laptop detects as external speaker..if there is no external sou d they should disable option. No good eye comfort preset mode. My hp24w and even BenQ offer less eye stress and seems good. Go for benq
3,A bit lack of sharpness in tests
3,Nice
3,"Using from more than 2 months.

It's not 1ms as they mentioned.

You have to change in monitor settings to extreme to get 4ms. In Normal you get 8ms."
3,"Best Performance, Really useful for me, I plug ps4 as well as PC just. The only issue is the screen is very glossy so it gets dirty after small touch. If they provide a screen guard then I will give this product 4 stars. No speakers at this price tag."

3,product is good but can't see videos from side
3,picture quality is very good. monitor setting interface is very simple to use. but viewing angle is not great due to TN panel. you can't be able to see the picture from left or right angle. you have to sit straight in front of the screen in order to see the picture properly.

3,Good Condition
3,Good product.

3,Anyway monitor working good
3,It was okay but it looks very small in size better to order a big display size monitor...
3,Good
3,"Thanks to flipkart...... because this product is in my habit......in my budget........

Product is good but processing is to slow.......
And type of product is good....
And I am Happy......."
3,Just ok
3,"1) 75hz will not work if you connect this as a secondary display.
2) they are lying in the picture, the bezels are no where near to edze. The bezels are too thick on all the side."
3,The Panel seems decent considering the price point. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a tilt feature. Monitors than this budget allows a little movement but this don't. Also the bezels are noticeable its not bezel less.
3,"Minor screen flickering observed within a month. I doubt the inbuilt quality.
Otherwise it's a good product."
3,Nice monitor
3,Not good for gaming.. There is no display port only hdmi port so you have to restrict ur gpu fps to avoid screen tearing.. Otherwise good for editing photoshop etc viewing angles was ok ok. At this price point ips display was good not better but good.
3,sound is less...
3,Moniter sounde not working. Speaker comblaind. But good moniter
3,This product is really good. But back side 4 pin nat it not here's. BenQ why this back side part 4 nat not available. Please problem solve me.
3,Ok
3,"Pros
Good picture quality
Anti glare and matte finish
Headphone port
Colour accuracy
Some gaming features like crosshair , freesync etc
75 hz believe me it makes difference a lot
Display is bright
Two HDMI ports
Very thin bezels and metal base stand which gives very premium look at this price also

CONS
Both of lg 22mk600m and 22mp68vq are exactly same and have some wierd issues as I had used both

If I come to product itself,
One pixel was dead. Thought of returning. But kept the monitor.

3,Pixel per inch is very less so quality is not so good.
3,Look is good. But display quality is not perfect.
3,"Just received the monitor. Works well but, you need to put two screws to mount the monitor on a stand . The screws are too small they won't fit."

hope this isnot suitable for who works more time.... WFH, Gamers..."
3,Monitor design is nice. Installation was simple with all the tools provided in the box. Only downside is the poor resolution.
3,Good for gaming but for productivity work not so good as text appears pixelated.
3,"Pixel density is low.
Other features are excellent."
3,Good product In this price I purchased it only 10500/-
3,"This comes with a 16a plug which won't fit in most of our normal sockets. It requires international 16a sockets. Considering the actual power consumption of the monitor, this is absolute overkill. Why does it comes with a 16a plug? To make our lives miserable? Maybe because this piece was never designed for Indian/international consumers. Which is still mediocre.



But the monitor is quite decent in itself. No complaints there."

Cons:
seeing slight screen bleeding problem."
3,"Pros:
Good looks
Slim bezels
Slick and smart

Cons:
Entire monitor tilts slightly towards the viewers left
I ain't sure if it's the issue with the all the models"
3,It's been a week I had bought. The monitor was very well packed and delivered. The product is of good quality but slight light bleeding.
3,Super IPS moniter
3,Nice looking
3,good
3,Screen having white colour after use
3,"The product is good but the price is much higher...,üò≠üò≠üò≠"
3,It is running just 23 days. Picture quality is very normal. Audio/Sound output is disturbing or not working when it is running as a TV. Port devices is very weak.
3,Decent product
3,"The colors on the display are not accurate and the text looks pixelated didn't expected this kind of product from brand like LG.
Go for any other 22 inch monitor"
3,"Backlight bleeding is UGH.
Built quality is great. But stand is very shaky.
Split screen facility is nice. Not sharp texts.
Not good for people who use dark mode like programmers.
Nice for basic stuff and amd freesync for gaming is working"
3,The Power Cord that comes bundled in the box won't fit in your normal power Socket. Rest it's as per specifications. Good!
3,A bit lack of sharpness in tests
3,Nice
3,"Using from more than 2 months.

It's not 1ms as they mentioned.

You have to change in monitor settings to extreme to get 4ms. In Normal you get 8ms."
3,"Best Performance, Really useful for me, I plug ps4 as well as PC just. The only issue is the screen is very glossy so it gets dirty after small touch. If they provide a screen guard then I will give this product 4 stars. No speakers at this price tag."
3,Average
3,Feel the dell
3,As compared to budget this is good item
3,display no clearance 1080 pixel video play slow
3,Good
3,"In this moniter has no speaker
And also too expensive
You should buy dell or hp moniter
In this range"
3,Yellow shades on all over the display. Not good for design purposes. Good for normal office works.
3,Ok
3,Looks decent lookwise but screen resolution is not 1080p full hd.
3,Picture quality is not as expected!
3,Its good.. But the delivery guys were handling it as if its football.

You can imagine how stable the base is. 2) The monitor height is not adjustable. 3)) It has an HDMI port, but somehow the connection is not great. I am using a mac with the monitor, which means I am using an adaptor. I often noticed that the display went off because of a loose connection, even if I secured the ends tightly. ...

3,Good product In this price I purchased it only 10500/-
3,"This comes with a 16a plug which won't fit in most of our normal sockets. It requires international 16a sockets. Considering the actual power consumption of the monitor, this is absolute overkill. Why does it comes with a 16a plug? To make our lives miserable? Maybe because this piece was never designed for Indian/international consumers. Which is still mediocre.



But the monitor is quite decent in itself. No complaints there."
3,Gaming and Display is better
3,Lower Brightness is too high for night use
3,So nice computer but there is a damage
3,Everything is good but the power supply cable is 15A cable this too big for any ups
3,"Delivery was on time. Packaging was good. Flipkart was good.

If I come to product itself,
One pixel was dead. Thought of returning. But kept the monitor.


Also I was used to IPS monitor; the display was superior to VA panel of this monitor. So giving 3 star."
3,Pixel per inch is very less so quality is not so good.
3,Look is good. But display quality is not perfect.
3,"Just received the monitor. Works well but, you need to put two screws to mount the monitor on a stand . The screws are too small they won't fit."
3,"good monitor in low cost.
but displaying thicker colors than Originals...
hope this isnot suitable for who works more time.... WFH, Gamers..."
3,Monitor design is nice. Installation was simple with all the tools provided in the box. Only downside is the poor resolution.
3,"Pros:
as listed by company
Cons:
seeing slight screen bleeding problem."
3,"Pros:
Good looks
Slim bezels
Slick and smart

Cons:
Entire monitor tilts slightly towards the viewers left
I ain't sure if it's the issue with the all the models"
3,It's been a week I had bought. The monitor was very well packed and delivered. The product is of good quality but slight light bleeding.

3,"Using from more than 2 months.

It's not 1ms as they mentioned.

You have to change in monitor settings to extreme to get 4ms. In Normal you get 8ms."
3,"Best Performance, Really useful for me, I plug ps4 as well as PC just. The only issue is the screen is very glossy so it gets dirty after small touch. If they provide a screen guard then I will give this product 4 stars. No speakers at this price tag."
3,Average
3,Feel the dell
3,As compared to budget this is good item
3,display no clearance 1080 pixel video play slow
3,HDMI port is not available. Other wise product is similar what is mentioned in description. You have to buy HDMI TO VGA converter if you are buying and you have HDMI port.
3,"Pros
Good picture quality
Anti glare and matte finish
Headphone port
Colour accuracy
Some gaming features like crosshair , freesync etc
75 hz believe me it makes difference a lot

White color and rounded design makes it better looking than other modems (usually black) and it would look cool if you happen to not hide your device in a corner and rather choose to place it on your desk.

3,The router works fine as for wifi but I'm unable to connect it with JioCall app with which we can receive calls and messages of the sim used in the router .

3,nice one...uisng 6 hrs daily...
3,It's a good router but 5g wifi range is very very small. 5g signal doesn't even reach adjacent room which is within 6 or 7 meters. In fact when I stand next to router and connect to 5g the signal is not full. 2g signal range is good. Overall not worth paying so much money.
3,Does the job. but it resets automatically if internet gies down from sp... and we have to reconfigure it again
3,WiFi range is poor
3,Good
3,"The product is good for extending the wifi range, as the name suggests

However the range is very short hardly 100 feet

Buy it only of you need a wifi connection in the next 100 feet radius"
3,"More worth the premium.
The coverage mentioned in the spec sheet is 4k sq feet but i don't think it would even cover 2400 sq ft area. The signal is not stable on the second floor with the extender on the first floor. The signal drops off frequently. A 3.5 Netgear router with 2 antenna does a better job. 4k sq feet coverage is utter false and bad marketing practice by tplink."

3,2G signal quite good. But 2G & 5G signal is poor inside house.

3,"The 2.4ghz band speed (even very close to the modem) is very slow. Hence, it is not acceptable for this price range."

If you want to buy a budget phone with a decent camera, it's definitely the best option. Again the thing I don't like there's no ultra wide angle camera, that's why you wouldn't capture ultra wide photos.

4,"I truly appreciate boult for the quality of this product. i would like to point out one imp. point that all gamers may like that many companies claim that there TWS has low latency, but as per my experience these boult TWS has lowest of latency and is no hindrance while gaming. Truly remarkable üëè Cheers to boult team."
4,"Pros:-1. Very good connectivity.
2.paires very fast less than 5 sec
3.good sound quality
4.good call quality
5. Mono mode works superb
6. great battery backup
Cons:-1.not comfortable for long use"
4,After using four months.... I m going to write review... Voice mismatch is created in both piece of earbuds. Right piece has less volume compare to than that of left one. And it is not suitable to your ears for long time. It is better to not purchase this model of earbuds.
4,"Product is good , sound is also good, good-quality of bass, design and build is also very good. It fitted good in your ear. Given 4 star because flipkart says it has 9mm driver but in Boult user manual it says it has 6mm of drivers. Otherwise product is good."
4,Its awesome. Looks good & works good. But not suitable for having small ear people.
4,"The earbuds are quite impressive for this price range....
But you might face some connection issues when the battery of the earbuds is less than 50%....
All in all I would recommend these earbuds......
The charging case is quite small and fits easily in your pocket.
And yes these are noise cancelling earbuds.
And yes they have magnetic charging clips so it won't fall off.
Also the case has charging indicators."
4,"The product is amazing. But I suggest you to don‚Äôt buy if you are getting this for calling purpose. Otherwise don‚Äôt thing anything, just buy it."
4,Sound for my hornor play is quite low.. While i am getting gud amount of sound for others phones...
4,"1. Worth of price its ok.
2. Sounds and bass also ok (8/10),but in gaming its poor.
3. Battery backup not bad its perfect.

I have seen many people and many YouTubers telling that bass is bit much. For for me it is pretty well balanced and works out pretty well. I cannot tell much about battery backup. Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easil...

4,This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging. Sound is good but bass could have been more and better. Have to use and check more for better opinion. Call quality is good though... Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.
4,"After using for more than 10 days I am writing this review...
1. Sound is okay nothing great
2. Noise cancellation is not good atall the other person can hear lots of disturbance in call
3. Battery is long lasting I used for total 12 days after one complete charge and I use it daily for atleast 5-6 hours for official calls. Secondly it takes less then an hour for 100% charge...

Sound quality: Average sound quality. Bass boosted but sound quality degrades in lower frequencies.

Loudness: Pretty loud. 25% volume is loud enough for indoors listening. Hardly used over 50% volume.

Noise isolation: Decent.

Fit: Excellent.

Battery: Hats off. Charge it, forget it.

Connectivity: Excellent. Signal drops rarely even after 2 walls.

Mic: No complaints.

Built quality: Below average. Pretty sure the charging port is going to break first. C...

4,For battery I could give 10 star if possible......pvc plastic is just okay. But voice on calling is crystal clear because of cvc technology. Earlier my wife always complain about my voice when I was using other Bluetooth earphone while calling but now she is happy and me too........ Don't take it otherwise I work out of station ....lol
4,"14/2/2021 I ordered it it arrived after 2 day's it was my first bluetooth neckband
it's bass and battery lifle is awesome over all sound 3.5-4 /5 but now after around 3 months it's one side (left ear) is not working properly for the last few days .
It's in warenty so I will update this review after I get touch with boat's customer service ."
4,"I've purchased it on OCT 2021 now SEP2022 almost near to a year. This Product is just awesome.
Pros:
Very Good Battery Backup of Maximum One Week of Heavy Usage.
Noise cancellation work also good.
This product is good for money.
Cons:
When we hear overtime the grip buds on the earpiece creates pain on ears!.
While travelling on bike the weight of buttons control bar is high on air and cannot able to wear it properly while riding."

I prefer it as a good bluetooth headset and excellent battery backup at this price range"

4,"I have oneplus base edition too and that's darn better than it in sound clarity and design, it's design is not for those who wear it while sleeping and also not comfortable to wear for a long but oneplus one is really a better option than this because of its body softness and in ear experience,yeah sound quality too."

Look is. Awesome üëçüëç"
4,"Fabulous Job by Boat , Just a bit quality control issue

- Loudness is pretty good at 60% volume
- Bass is fantastic
- My neckband has one wire side bit loose at particular level it is apparent when it is not plugged into ears so not much of concern but i have option for replace via service center for that as well.

- Battery is humongous, trust me , I haven't charged this since i recieved and i used it roughly around 2-3 hrs daily on average and it still stands so strong.

- Design and build is top notch.
- Touch is working fine.
If you are someone who just want to do your work like studying, listening music in free time then just go for this product. It is very good in that sense but if you're thinking to buy this for gaming and stuff then this one is not a best option."

4,Sound quality is acceptable with price range.bass quality is super . Design and build quality is good but personally i Don't like tha wair .all thing is good is this price segment but i have some issue with this mic and the bottoms .
4,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."

Sound quality: BOTH ARE AMAZING GIVES PERFECT SOUND.

Build quality is superb, metal heads are premium looking quality. Overall in this price segment it's a good earphone."
4,"Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.
Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.

4,"This earphone is truly worth it's price i.e. 500. Got it 2 days ago and using it since then. Sound quality is awsm and bass too. The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt...

4,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume. But I know most of average Indians who are looking for a budget earphone will most certainly lov...

Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

Initial review on Day 1.
I will re-edit this after 1month.
So my day 1 experience is good with these Realme buds 2.
Let me tell you any headphone takes a while to give its best and it takes few weeks of usage for that.
So right now i have used these for about 40 mins and listening to saved music in Poweramp as well as built in normal player and then lastly played songs on youtube.
I would say it sounds great on PowerAmp.
As far as youtube or online stream concerned i would say the o...

4,Realmi buds 2 very hard bass and sound quality much better. You feel high up music. It's compact size also good. It's 10-30% volume very slowly and 90-100 % sounds quality compromise not clear hearing people says . 30-80% volume very best for hearing music but every time you gets high and better bass. If audio jack are in shape of l types connector than it much better. It's a very good earphones. I love this earphone .

Cons:
1. Earbuds built quility is bot good, my ear hurts so much because or their big size.

Battery should be enough for daily users and some tweets have to be done for optimal performance.

4,Battery back power saving ok but full features on only for 18 to 24 hrs .. But all things super watch u purchased recommended 10k.. Daily charging .. all top üëå üôå
4,Awesome product. But battery life sucks it's last long upto 1 1/2 days with always on display off. And when it's on its last long upto minimum 20 hours and maximum 22 hours for my point of view. Other than that it is amazing watch and it's UI is smooth after some days 4.5 beta version will be there on this watch. After than watch goes like makhan.
4,"A beautiful watch with all the things that is required in a smart watch.
Pros: Sharp and bright display, loaded with features that is required. Works like a charm with Samsung Galaxy series
Cons: Battery life. lasts a bit more than a day if AOD is not enabled. Full charging takes more than 2 hours."
4,"Gorgeous display , good activity tracking and wear Os is added advantage ...it has many features but bit disappointed with some features are not working in India and also some features are not functional for non Samsung Android users . Else it a good looking best Android watch."
4,"I bought it two weeks ago and was really excited for hands-on. The device is really very light and attractive. Design is curved and feels so satisfying. All apps and activities work good . No lag and calling options are great . Also has playstore in built. Assistant and maps work great. Can be used lightly for a day and a half to move with but a heavy usage could only get you 22hrs of usage. Charging is slow compared to others takes two hours even in speed charger. But really worth it within ...

Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...

Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.

Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership."
4,"Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles.
About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging."

4,Nikon D5600 is a good entry level camera but good for still photography not suitable for video shoots. For basic starter this camera is off course good at very economical cost and photos taken are quite good. For better photography you need a 35 or 50 mm prime lens with aperture 1.8 for good shots.
4,"Great delivery and great product. Although the packaging was missing the sd card, but flipkart was quick to address it and provide me a gift card for the value of that card.
Much appreciated work by flipkart team.

About the camera, it is an awesome device. I tried clicking some pictures in the lockdown and I got some really great result.

More details to come after some usage"

4,"It's good product for me, and words abilities is average."
4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
4,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."

4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
4,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."

4,Excellent for home use for occasional printing only but very useful for regular scanning use compared to its affordable cost. Printing/cartridge cost is too high so not suitable for regular or heavy printing.

4,"The printer is very useful for personal use, not reliable for commercial use. I got only 50 pages per refill/cartridge. Best quality with original HP cartridge and ink. Can use ink like turbo HP 803 but lower in quality. I tried but printer is not showing ink level."
4,"Good printer for the price. Scanning quality is not that good. Printing quality is totally acceptable. Printing is a bit slow. Pretty noisy but I guess that's the same with every other inkjet printer out there.
Overall verdict - Good All in one printer at reasonable price."
4,"Best part is looks and better part is good printing quality and fast printing. However, the ink consumption is not satisfactory. Huge expense and less output. Go for this if you want to save time. But money? Get ready to spend 500 after 200 pages."
4,Nice product. Brought in 2300. Value for money and good for home purpose but not good if you want to use high printing. Since consume more ink. Cartridge can be refilled but Extra care for leaking of ink should be taken care. Liquid toner require to refill. Overall value for money.

4,The Product is quite satisfactory and the best by Flipkart is its delivery time. It's SIMPLY AWESOME. Scanning work is great. Good Deal of printing. Good for those who require it for home purposes(not for offices) as ink drains a bit fast as it seems but quite good for those who do not require a lot per month. For those requiring less than 300 pages a month. Overall Copying and scanning is good. You get both color and black cartridge already in the pack which would work for ~200 pages.

I hope it's helpful as I found this after a month of having this printer."
4,"It is perfect printer for home use, assembly is really easy, for software I recommend to go on cannon site and search printer for driver installation, black and color print speed is ok, I need to test it for cartridge durability but every time when you take the print you will get the information of remaining cartridge level."

4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.

4,I want the printer Bill. I don't got it. delivery boy said you will send me. but u don't send me. please send fast.
4,"Pretty average thing, don't expect much."
4,For personal work this is good. It runs on WiFi as well as wired connection. Has scanner. Mobile phone prints directly ( without the help of computer). Document print quality is good. Even small size type prints sharp. Only black solids do not have colour density due to dye based inks. Colour photographs on glossy paper print nice. Can not say anything about colour fastness. It is bulky in size.

4,Good
4,Ink is genuinely good. I found no difference in the printing quality. But one thing I want to mention is that being a cheap ink it's printing yield is low. I only got around 1000 pages printed by the black ink. Original ink yielded around 2500 pages. But I think it's good for its price.
4,It's okay for normal use. The colour must be bit darker. While printing i can feel the difference with the original vs this. Not that bad. Get's the job done.

4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
4,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."

4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .

Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."

Anyways, about this product its good and compact in design. It has few important features like coping, scanning etc.
This product is worth to buy but the greatest drawback will lye on its cartridge.
One black cartridge cost around Rs.800 and it can print only 150 pages so image the printer cost Rs.2400 but the single cartridge cost rs.800 now we can make out how we get ...

The only con which i want to highlight is there are no buttons to adjust the brightness of the screen, which i think every screen must have. When i work sometimes in the evenings, i feel like I need to reduce the brightness of the screen which i cant. So here you go, my review.

And the monitor stand is too weak, if you touch the monitor it will rock for next few seconds ‚Äì which is super annoying.
Only good for media consumption and basic computing."

Pros :
1. Curved baby curved - the display environment to a distance less than 3 m is so beautiful when playing games & watching movies.
2. One & only one of a kind - only Samsung does it.

But there is one defect that I don't like at all, as it was present in my last DELL monitor (about the same price range) too. It is that the screen is half dark on the upper half and light on the lower half. The more you tilt the monitor vertically up or down, the more you can see the differences."
4,"I was looking for a low budget tv..Because of its low sound from inbuilt speaker, I just added an external speaker to its aux sound output and used it as a tv... For a small room it can use as a tv with good clarity..I got it for 3281Rs+ 644 super coins in bgb days"
4,"Good Picture Quality, great performance and wall mount feature is a added attraction but the screws for wall mount were not on the monitor and not in the carton...."
4,perfect one ...but sound quality is not so good enough but can manage to hear a low audible voice well in this price it's an awesome gives flowless 60 Hz well if can manage to go a 2k would recommend ips screen those who are buying for gaming would be satisfied but would enjoy the gaming feeling well for using with setup box it's nice it's has HDMI VGA and 1 in and out 3.5mm jack
4,Perfect n nice one monitor at this price. VGA and HDMI port both are working nicely. Inbuilt speakers sounds low but it is an extra bonus. working as TV with set top box through HDMI cable. very satisfied.

The picture quality is awesome the coulors are vibrant
And the hdmi,vga works wellüëçüèªüëçüèªYou can buy it
Minus point:-
If you don't want to buy external speakers
Don't buy it seriously it speaker's volume is very lo
Even if you sit one inch away from the moniter
The sound wil be not enough üòïüòï
So don't buy it if you are not buying external speakers

4,Earlier I used LG 21.5 inch VA panel. The viewing angle is very much dependent if we looks it from top to bottom. But this IPS panel is entirely different from VA panel. This is exactly the same views like what we see in our IPS mobile. So everyone must look for IPS Panel monitors...

4,Nice
4,This monitor is so cool and very perfect lg24mk600 looking just owshom
4,"It is supposed to be plug and play, but after I first plugged it, I was getting driver related issues which didn't stop even after I installed drivers from LG website. But it is working fine without drivers since I reinstalled the OS, which I should not have to."
4,Nice one. But till not enough time to comment about performance and durability.
4,"Good product,. But delivery very late"
4,Crystal clear vision and over package value for money but can do with built in speakers though.
4,"As per the specification, the refresh rate is 75. But actually it has only 60 Hz refresh rate."
4,"Details of this product mention 75Hz, but it's 60Hz max. Edge to edge window is still not setup. Build quality is good. Screen size is massive."
4,Excellent View and excellent picture quality but after month use there are two dead pixel on the screen now I don't know what to do.
4,It's a good monitor. Only disadvantage for me is that its height cannot be adjusted.
4,Decent monitor. But has some stability issues. The monitor panel doesn‚Äôt fit very snuggly and the base is lighter than required. As a result the whole monitor shakes on small shake to the table on which the monitor stands.
4,"Except viewing angles, the monitor is very good. Consumes less power, Has great backlight, Has great contrast, Blacks are pure black."
4,Value for money..
4,Good Product
4,Picture quality is good so far I have used
4,"Screen clarity is good, good colour reproduction. Sturdy table stand. Only department which this monitor lacks is in sound. We can't expect sound bar kind of sound from a monitor, but still we can expect of a laptop sound, you can't even hear the sound from this monitor. Except this, excellent product."
4,Awesome quantity. And it's actually a big size screen. Also have 75hz refresh rate max.
4,Good monitor. Does the job
4,Good
4,Large Screen. Superb experience after doing the work on computer system. There is no speaker which feels bad. There is no screen up and down facilities. Difficult to adjust the location of screen.
4,Very good monitor..and timely delivery by filpkart
4,Good
4,"Worthy product. Got it for 8.5k in Nov 2020. Except white light bleeding at one spot, rest all is perfect. White light bleeding is noticable only when it is blank."

4,"Worth the money. Working with my MacBook Air.
1080p at this screensize, sharpness is slightly low.

But very good monitor for watching movies, coding, browsing etc"

Comes with 16amp cable so had to buy new cable to connect.

Also, no hdmi cable in box so had buy hdmi cable as well.

Again, quality is best."

3. It lacks speakers and there is no audio connectivity ports (you will get the dell soundbar mount in the monitor though, but need to spend 3000rs extra for the soundbar)

The monitor is LCD not LED
It's only provided with VGA cable not HDMI
The power plug provided with it is of 16 A type, we can't plug that into our normal socket (5A), so we need to buy extra power cord of 5A and an HDMI cable."

4,"Product is as expected , i have choosen due to Dell after using 2weeks writing this review.

You can adjust Height
No effects on your eye great quality pictures

Cons -. No hdmi cable provided ,i purchased separately."
4,Without a display port in cpu can‚Äôt utilize USB ports in monitor for data transfer. Apart from this it‚Äôs at par to expectations.
4,"Bought it to use as secondary monitor with laptop. Quality is superb no doubt. Amazing angle/hight adjustment.

Comes with 16amp cable so had to buy new cable to connect.

Also, no hdmi cable in box so had buy hdmi cable as well.

Again, quality is best."

only due to response time 5to8 second and refresh rate 60hz picture comes blurry on videos.

1. If you are buying for coding purposes i would recommend buying a monitor with higher resolution, with this full hd resolution the pixels are visible.

2. The contract ratio is not that great, you can still see the black bars very clearly with 25% brightness.

3. It lacks speakers and there is no audio connectivity ports (you will get the dell soundbar mount in the monitor though, but need to spend 3000rs extra for the soundbar)

cons

4,"Very Good buy, got it for 10400. Has read mode which is very useful during programming. Only drawback is that it doesn't have usb ports. Only 2 hdmi 1 vga and aux out. If you just need a very good hd 24 inch display and ready to connect to external speakers then go for this."
4,"The monitor is very good. Awesome colors and viewing angle. Delivery was also quick. Thanks flipkart for that.
I got this monitor for 7500 rs. A little back light bleeding was there. But that's completely normal for an IPS panel I guess.

No inbuilt speaker. Other monitors have speaker in this budget. Not so good quality thought. But nice to have something than nothing."
4,Really a good one fora budget gaming pc and best among all the brands..realyy a good one to try and the size of the screen is also very perfect for the gaming purpose

I was extremely happy with the product till now since I started using it from last days. Picture quality is good and happy with the product. I recommend to buy this product with out any second thought."
4,"..Decent look , great display...value for money moniter.......Thanks Flipkart for safer and faster delivery.....................
........after 10 days use , found the only but major corn in this moniter and that is the lack of blue light filter (eye care ) feature. Now a days every branded moniter is providing this feature , where as the LG provide every thing but not this important feature....and also the brightness is on quite higher side.....though there is reader mode but not finding it ...

4,Earlier I used LG 21.5 inch VA panel. The viewing angle is very much dependent if we looks it from top to bottom. But this IPS panel is entirely different from VA panel. This is exactly the same views like what we see in our IPS mobile. So everyone must look for IPS Panel monitors...
4,"Very good ips monitor viewing angles and color reproduction are great it comes with color calibrated out of the box it supports two hdmi one vga and audio output port for gaming purpose 5ms response time with 75hertz refresh rate.

After 10 days review

Battery enough for 1 day even 24*7 Internet will be on and mostly internet usage

A13 Bionic chip will give more high performance without hanging

Audio stereo speakers will give Dolby atoms sound with crystal clear

Video recording is like cinematic shots of every sec can be a 4K 60fps. Just awesome this phone

5,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.

Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !"
5,"It is just awesome mobile for this price from Apple,

After 10 days review

Battery enough for 1 day even 24*7 Internet will be on and mostly internet usage

Camera is just awesome cool , android 64 MP is equal to this just 12 MP

A13 Bionic chip will give more high performance without hanging

Audio stereo speakers will give Dolby atoms sound with crystal clear

Video recording is like cinematic shots of every sec can be a 4K 60fps. Just awesome this phone

5,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
5,Again back to apple iphone after a gap of 2-3 years. It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it.

Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.

5,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.

It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it.

Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.

On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

5,"The best so far. Battery beast and bass will be better than many similar products ( use suitable bud)

Friends and relatives who tried once got addicted instantly and asked me to order. Out of stock everywhere.

5,"Lot of confusions before buying, whether to buy neckband or airdopes. At last i settled with Boat neckband. Already using Boat headphones & speakers so i believed in sound quality & clarity.
Really best neckband at this price point. Sound is soo clear, enjoying music with clear & quality bass.
Battery backup is soo good, came 100% charged and still 97%
Overall its a good quality product. Go for it guys."

For occasional music lovers who love high bass and balanced sound this is must have.I rarely write review but this product performance forced to write a review."

5,"Superb design,features and looks in a single word i just wanna say wow. Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery and you guys go for it... absolutely awesome watch i have ever seen."
5,Many smart watches sold at higher price by keeping music as additional feature but this watch is having awesome features at affordable price . Worthy buy .
5,"It is a must for tech savvy and workout loving persons.
If used in a proper manner, it is a best utility tool of organizing, health and fitness monitoring"
5,"Smartwatch for android users can't get better than this. Use it wisely, you will be able to get 36 hours+ from full charge.

Gives range of smart features, tracks your activities, gives you directions on your watch screen when running maps in your phoneüëå, maps your walking/cycling well, hello it has play store.

Forget about battery capacity, its a useful beast."
5,"Considering the price of 8999 in BBD sale , it is so much better than other 5k-6k smart watch/band. With accurate data of step count, calorie count, sleep (deep sleep and normal sleep) and heart rate monitoring"
5,Best watch in this sale price segment of 12.5k Everything works best and plus point if you have a Samsung phone.
5,One of the best Android smartwatch available right now. It looks quite stylish and at this price this is the best watch which we can get. The only negative aspect of this watch is its battery but that depends on your usage i.e if you don't turn on most of its sensors then you will get around 2 days or maximum 2 and half day usage.
5,"Think in deep before buying , I will recommend if you belong to samsung ecosystem if not go for Amaze fit pro it gives same features with super battery .
Battery is very poor max to max it will withstand for 1.5 days in single charge .

Rest all wrt to features are just legendary (can't see better features than this at this rate )."
5,"Got for 13.5K on offer. It's the best Android smart watch available in the market. Right from screen to ease of use. Battery is okay as per it's size, and goes up to 2-3 days. I got this for notification and navigation while driving and it's doing way too fine with that."
5,"As per the value for money ratio this is best Android smartwatch you can get. I got it for 8999 using bank offers and at that price this is great watch.
Just a concern regarding battery, the backup is not that great but you can squeeze more juice out of it by doing some tweaks here and there.
I too was first 2 days very disappointed by battery but it got 2 updates and I fully reset the watch once and make some tweaks to save battery.
Battery has now optimised well and learn to save power acco...

One downside is the battery life which is not great but okay. Though, you can stretch it to more than a day on a moderate use and limited functionality.

5,"The price point at which I received this watch was phenomenal.
I got it on sale around 14000.
Watch performs well, SpO2 and bpms are measured accurately in my case. I have seen that on medical grade device during my treatment.
It caculates distance with marginal error of 20 to 30 mtrs, which is acceptable, may be depends on walking style. There is a park near my home which has kms marked and it almost matches. that. .Marker showed 1300 mtrs and my watch shows 1.27kms.

5,"Pro----

An awesome watch as far as my experience of using it for a couple of weeks is concerned. I have only used only a single health tracking feature though (walking) and it was pretty much accurate so I think all other features will perform the same. A day of battery backup if all notifications are turned on and you see the time every now and then. Power saving mode doubles that operating time i.e 2 days if you have charged to 100 percent untill it goes to 15 to 20 percent. Has all other ...

5,Thank you so much for your service... I recieved my product within the timeline and faster than usual. Thanks once again!
5,"No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy .
but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 .
like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results .
not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .

70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .

Edited on 16 Jan 2020
So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price. I am not highlighting the features which all dslr have. but the best features which you will get in this price which none other dslr can give you today are
1. Articulated Touch screen.

bast for YouTube purpose
focusing is fast in photo only

5,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
5,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.

Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."

Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern.
But never regret after buying it"

Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.

I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.

I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.

Not so good for video as it hunts for focus when we move from a subject which is annoying. I don't do much video so I really love this camera.
5,"Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
